    <h2>What is a PWA?</h2>
  
    <p>
      A Progressive Web App (PWA) is basically just a website with some added features, which enable it to provide an 
      app-like user-experience.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This means it can work practically just like a native iOS or Android app. It can be installed to the home screen 
      of your mobile device, work offline and receive push notifications, among other things. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A well-designed PWA is indistinguishable from a native app, but it also offers some strong added benefits:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        It's  just a website! You don't need to build separate apps anymore. If you have a website, you can easily 
        turn it into and iOS and Android app as well!
      </li>
      <li>
        A PWA is much smaller than a native app. Your users no longer need to install tens of megabytes of code
      </li>
      <li>
        No need to get your app into the App Store or Play Store. Just share the link to your website and users can 
        install it as an app
      </li>
      <li>
        There's no need to get users to install updates anymore. When you release a new version of your app, all your 
        users automatically get the new version
      </li>
      <li>
        By default, PWAs are served over HTTPS and are therefore safe and secure
      </li>
      <li>
        PWAs are lightweight and offer high performance
      </li>
      <li>
        Especially on Android, a PWA can almost do anything a native app can
      </li>
    </ul>
